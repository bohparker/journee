1. Create virtual environment:
	$ python3 -m venv venv
	$ source venv/bin/activate
	# install initial pip packages that don't have versions
	$ pip install -r init-req.txt
	# add packages with versions to requirements.txt
	$ pip freeze > requirements.txt

2. Create .env file and set:
	SECRET_KEY
	DATABASE_URL

3. Database initialization
	$ flask db init
	add models to migrations/env.py
	import app.models
	from app.app import db

	$ flask db migrate -m "initial migration"
	$ flask db upgrade

	take migrations/ and instance/ out of .gitignore so they are included
		in version control
